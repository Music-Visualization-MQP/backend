# Music Visualization MQP

This is a project started by Ivy Bixler.

An MQP is the undergraduate capstone project at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

One goal of this project is to write a robust service that can gather the data of many spotify users. 

Users will be able to access and download their data any time.

There is potential to partially opensource user data meaning anyone can see someones history. This would be opt in opt out, potential for a social aspect. 


Right now all this does is register new users and get them to give permission for this service to use their data. 

Functionality is buggy and very basic. I am focusing on writing tests and eliminating bugs before moving...
further into serious development again.

I have not really been back to this code since around september of 2023. 

I am going to try and go through and clean up maybe writing some tests. 

Docker is seeming like a prime candidate.
