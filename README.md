# collageify

This is a project written by Ivy Bixler.

The goal of this project is to write a robust service that can gather the data of many spotify users. 

Users will be able to access and download their data any time.

There is potential to completely opensource the database meaning anyone can see someones history.

I am still considering that feature, however. 

Right now all this does is register new users and get them to give permission for me to use their data.

Functionality is buggy and very basic. I am focusing on writing tests and eliminating bugs before moving...
further into serious development again.
